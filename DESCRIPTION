Description: A pipeline for carrying out end-to-end Power Analysis for differential expression in scRNA-seq data.
             Allows the user to carry out sum-pseudobulk DGE analysis (implemented in edgeR), which can then be used
             as part of the main power analysis. A down-sampling approach is used, and the % of True Positive DEGs detected
             are reported (with many layers of complexity). Other complementary analyses may also be carried out
             using this package.
