\arguments{
\item{bulkDE}{DGE analysis output for a bulk RNA-seq dataset: rows (rownames) should be the genes, columns should be tissues, and entries should be significance levels}

\item{inpath}{path storing the down-sampled DGE analysis for each single-cell dataset}

\item{range_downsampled}{vector or list containing values which the data will be downsampled at, in ascending order}

\item{celltype}{the cell type we are focusing on (name as it appears in cell type sub-directory name)}

\item{sampled}{downsampling carried out based on what (either "individuals" or "cells")}

\item{bulk_cutoff}{percentage (proportion between 0 and 1), specified so that we select DEGs common across >= bulk_cutoff of the tissues in the Bulk dataset}

\item{pvalue}{the cut-off p-value used to select DEGs (for both, bulk and scRNA-seq datasets)}

\item{celltype_names}{list of the names specifying this celltype in each DGE analysis output (in order they appear in the directory), if all are not the same as celltype}

\item{fontsize_axislabels}{font size for axis labels in plot}

\item{fontsize_axisticks}{font size for axis tick labels in plot}

\item{fontsize_title}{font size for plot title}

\item{fontsize_legendlabels}{font size for legend labels in plot}

\item{fontsize_legendtitle}{font size for legend title in plot}

\item{plot_title}{plot title}
